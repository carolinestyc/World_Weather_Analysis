# World_Weather_Analysis
### Challenge 6
## Project Overview
The PlanMyTrip App is in beta tesing and incorporating changes to take it to the next level. I have added weather data to the app to allow users to filter for weather preferences in their search. Now, the user can select weather preferences as they filter through potential travel destinations. The beta user selected preferred maximum and minimum temperatures and the search is narrowed down. In this example, a minimum temperature of 55 degrees and a max temperature of 75 degrees were selected. Although this brought up 180 options around the world, it was narrowed down to the country of South Africa where we could identify multiple hotels across many cities but within one country. As you can see in the table below, 5 hotels across 5 different cities were identified (the trip starting and ending at the same location). As you can see, the average temperature across all 5 locations is around 69 degrees, allowing the traveler to plan accordingly for all stops.

As you can see in the table below, the route throughout the different stops is also provided to give the traveler a general idea of the path they will be taking throughout South Africa via driving. Starting and ending in Saldanha; getting an excellent tour of all of southern/coastal South Africa.

By clicking on the points, we can see additional data for each destination. Hotel Name, City, current weather conditions, and temperatures. Supplying the traveler, with brief information on their trip.

This weather information is a great addition for travelers who prefer certain climates or want to pack accordingly for their trip. Any user can now input their preferred temps and get their most ideal vacation destination.
